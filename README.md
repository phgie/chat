# Customer Chat

Imagine a situation where you need to implement a chat software for our customer service to interact with our customers.

_How would the quick win solution look like and how would the state-of-the-art solution look like?_

Implement a simple solution for a chat that enables customers to send messages to customer service.

Talking points / topics to be considered:
- Which objects / classes would you create? 
- How do they interact? 
- How does the frontend interact with your classes? 
- Which enhancements come to your mind when talking about chat software solutions?
